# ðŸŒ® Tacochain - My Personal Blockchain Project
In my quest to learn Rust and how blockchains work, I have created this project. This will be a blockchain I use to learn, so it probably isn't best to use for production. It is called tacochain because I **love** tacos ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ® !!

## Contributing
This project is mostly for learning myself, but you can always take a peak at the code. If you find a better way to do something, feel free to submit an issue (I love to learn and get better).
